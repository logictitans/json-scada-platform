# SVG Synoptic Display Editor

This is a separate project. This SVG editor is based on the Inkscape vector editor.

This editor is based on the popular open-source Inkscape editor, it was modified to allow markup SCADA-like animations in the SVG file with links to data that can be later provided at runtime.
Any graphics properties can be animated with live data, such as fill/stroke colors, size, position, rotation, etc.
